# Remote-Input-Control
A java-based remote desktop utility to share mouse and keyboard input over a network

This utility was written near 2015.

It makes use of Swing based graphics and mouse capturing in order to trap input events.

From there the input is sent over the network and re-enacted on the client machine.
